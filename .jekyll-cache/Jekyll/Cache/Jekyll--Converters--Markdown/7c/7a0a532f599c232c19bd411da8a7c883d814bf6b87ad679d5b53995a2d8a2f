I"â<p>I was tasked with exploring strategy for an improved Search experience that would be implemented as part of a re-launch of Rhapsodyâ€™s product under the Napster brand. My process involved looking at the history of Search interfaces, benchmarking UIs across the music streaming services landscape, and building an understanding around how a search can be much more than just typing into a box. The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Search-Patterns-Discovery-Peter-Morville-ebook/dp/B0039QGJD4" target="_blank"><em>Search Patterns: Design for Discovery</em></a> was particularly inspiring during this project.</p>

<p>Read about the concept and how I arrived at it <a href="/projects/find-concept/">here</a>.</p>
