SoundTracking was a popular music service based on sharing songs accompanied by a custom photo, personal note, and tagged location creating “music moments” — digital music posts that captured your life as told through the lens of music.

As a founding product designer, I helped to grow the service from concept to a robust community with over 300,000 active users and 3M+ downloads. The service earned some recognition by Apple in 2011 when it was named a Best Music App. SoundTracking was acquired by Rhapsody International in 2014.

Tapping into music’s social nature, features were designed with community in mind — whether that meant reacting to posts through comments, giving 'likes' and 'loves', or seamlessly posting to other services like Twitter and Instagram.
