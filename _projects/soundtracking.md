# Music Discovery via Music Moments

SoundTracking was a popular music service based on sharing songs accompanied by a custom photo, personal note, and tagged location creating “music moments” — digital music posts that captured your life as told through the lens of music.

As a founding product designer, I helped to grow the service from concept to a robust community with over 300,000 active users and 3M+ downloads. The service earned some recognition by Apple in 2011 when it was named a Best Music App. SoundTracking was acquired by Rhapsody International in 2014.

Part of the first generation of mobile-first services, SoundTracking encouraged users to share and react to music moments as they occurred throughout the day and within the world

Tapping into music’s social nature, features were designed with community in mind — whether that meant reacting to posts through comments, giving 'likes' and 'loves', or seamlessly posting to other services like Twitter and Instagram.
