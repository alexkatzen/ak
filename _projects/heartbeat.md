Heartbeat Health is a NY-based startup fighting heart disease through <em>preventative cardiology</em>. By helping patients to understand heart disease risk and providing access to a team of world class team cardiologists, they proactively work to
eliminate the disease before it starts. I assisted the team in preparing their product for a Beta release.

## A Problem of Awareness

A core challenge for Heartbeat is creating public awareness around the fact that most people are at risk of developing heart disease in their lifetime — it is the leading cause of death in both men and women, accounting for more deaths than all
cancers combined. The good news is that heart disease is preventable. First by knowing your actual heart health, and second through leading a heart-healthy lifestyle.

Heartbeat's strategy in convincing people coming in to the practice to get themselves checked out. Getting a patient in for that first heart-check however, is a challenge in itself. When I came aboard, the team was already experimenting with the idea
of a risk assessment people could take online to determine if they should come in. My task as the product designer was to come in and help them define and design the user experience of this step.

## Patient-centered Approach

The Heartbeat team had already spent some time categorizing the types of patients they envisioned coming in. We used this initial thinking as a basis to create <a

Next, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ve634HA9V070lLvJ198nwLZqZvVMeyeI" target="_blank">narratives</a> were created behind each patient based on their backstory, demographic, needs and potential solutions. Using these, I then established a
user story <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15tHqNh0g0SuM7EV_haE-IGjNOURVD5s3kRXGKKvDck4/edit?usp=sharing">matrix</a> by which I could then <a
  href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eZWSZU4mbpAtjBvEQlw68SSQ7914zowhIZL20dYBntg/edit?usp=sharing">rank</a> which stories were most impactful across the most patients.

## Voice & Tone

Heartbeat was also looking for attention to their brand and visual language. To kick this off I led the team through an exercise with the <a href="https://branding.cards/" target="_blank">Brand Deck</a> to quickly identify values on which to build
design on.

## Wireframe Ideation

With an understanding of the patients, a distillation of Heartbeat’s values, and important user stories defined, we had a starting point from which wireframe ideation could start.

## Visual Design

Moving to mockups, we iterated on visuals and communication emphasizing education around heart disease risk.
