I designed and built a website for <a href="http://undiscoveredsf.com" target="_blank">Undiscovered SF</a>, a non-profit venture designed to jump-start economic activity within, and public awareness of <a href="http://www.somapilipinas.org/">SOMA Pilipinas</a>, San Francisco's Filipino cultural district. The marquee event is a monthly creative night market featuring food, retail, and performances that attracts thousands of people each month.

## Attendees & Paricipants

A free night market like Undiscovered SF attracts a wide variety of peopleâ€”attendees and vendors alike. In order to identify appropriate user stories to design around, eight user <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz7oHkoJk9Q4bW9jQV9JNkZNNXM?usp=sharing" target="_blank">personas</a> were crafted to represent key crowd demographics.

For each individual, a user narrative was written which identified 1) how they might have found out about the night market, 2) how they engaged with the site and event 3) why they come come back, and 4) why they would refer the experience to others. Thinking about each user's motivations and needs this way illuminated <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CWypn2WwdE6hD4mNstqmZviSVQoumf1EKT7pt7SqpWU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">user stories</a> we could be confident in designing around.

## Site Map

A site map was created describing a potential site architecture that would meet the needs expressed in the user stories.

## Wireframes

With an understanding of the intended site architecture and user goals, rough wireframes were created and quickly iterated on with stakeholders to build consensus around the plan for the UI.

## Design + Development

The Undiscovered team already had an established visual language including logo, colors, and typography. Leveraging this, rough mockups were produced to build consensus around a starting visual direction for the website, after which design was iterated weekly via feedback loop through a live development site.
