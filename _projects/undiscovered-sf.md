I designed and built a website for <a href="http://undiscoveredsf.com" target="_blank">Undiscovered SF</a>, a non-profit venture designed to jump-start economic activity within, and public awareness of <a href="http://www.somapilipinas.org/">SOMA Pilipinas</a>, San Francisco's Filipino cultural district. The marquee event is a monthly creative night market featuring food, retail, and performances that attracts thousands of people each month.

## Attendees & Paricipants

A free night market like Undiscovered SF attracts a wide variety of peopleâ€”attendees and vendors alike. In order to identify appropriate user stories to design around, eight user <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0Bz7oHkoJk9Q4bW9jQV9JNkZNNXM?usp=sharing" target="_blank">personas</a> were crafted to represent key crowd demographics.

For each individual, a user narrative was written which identified 1) how they might have found out about the night market, 2) how they engaged with the site and event 3) why they come come back, and 4) why they would refer the experience to others. Thinking about each user's motivations and needs this way illuminated <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CWypn2WwdE6hD4mNstqmZviSVQoumf1EKT7pt7SqpWU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">user stories</a> we could be confident in designing around.

## Site Map

A site map was created describing a potential site architecture that would meet the needs expressed in the user stories.

## Wireframes

With an understanding of the intended site architecture and user goals, rough wireframes were created and quickly iterated on with stakeholders to build consensus around the plan for the UI.

## Mockups

Undiscovered SF already had an established style guide including logo, colors, and typography. Leveraging this, mockups were created following the wires to establish an initial visual direction to start the site on.

## Development & Design

After a quick round of mock-ups, development began and all further design decisions were discussed and iterated on using a live development site.
