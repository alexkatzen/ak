description: Earth Rot is a 1970 album by David Axelrod. The tracks on side 1, "The Warnings", include lyrics adapted from the Book of Isaiah, while the songs on side 2, "The Signs", include lyrics adapted from "Song Of The Earth Spirit", a Navajo creation legend. Earth Rot is in effect a cantata for the planet, or, in Axe's own words "contemporary music with ancient yet timely words set to the theme of ecology."

Call me *Ishmael*. Some years ago–*never mind how long
precisely*–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off
the spleen and regulating the circulation.
