# Heartbeat

Heartbeat Health is a NY-based startup fighting heart disease through preventative cardiology. By helping patients to understand heart disease risk and providing access to a team of world class team cardiologists, they proactively work to eliminate the disease before it starts. I assisted the team in preparing their product for a Beta release.

## A Problem Of Awareness

A core challenge for Heartbeat is creating public awareness of the fact that most people are at risk of developing heart disease in their lifetime. It is the leading cause of death in both men and women, accounting for more deaths than all cancers combined. The good news is that heart disease is preventable; first by knowing your actual heart health, and second through leading a heart-healthy lifestyle.

Heartbeat's strategy in convincing people coming in to the practice to get themselves checked out. Getting a patient in for that first heart-check however, is a challenge in itself. When I came aboard, the team was already experimenting with the idea of a risk assessment people could take online to determine if they should come in. My task as the product designer was to come in and help them define and design the user experience of this step.

## Patient-centered Approach

The Heartbeat team had already spent some time categorizing the types of patients they envisioned coming in. We used this initial thinking as a basis to create <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ve634HA9V070lLvJ198nwLZqZvVMeyeI?usp=sharing" target="_blank">personas</a> from which to write feature stories.

Next, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ve634HA9V070lLvJ198nwLZqZvVMeyeI" target="_blank">narratives</a> were created behind each patient based on their backstory, demographic, needs and potential solutions. Through these narratives, I then established a user story <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15tHqNh0g0SuM7EV_haE-IGjNOURVD5s3kRXGKKvDck4/edit?usp=sharing">matrix</a> by which I could then <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eZWSZU4mbpAtjBvEQlw68SSQ7914zowhIZL20dYBntg/edit?usp=sharing">rank</a> which stories were most impactful across the most patients.
